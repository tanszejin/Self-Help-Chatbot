He’s probably the\\nlast person on earth you would ever look to for life advice or expect to see in\\nany sort of self-help book.\\nWhich is why he’s the perfect place to start.\\nBukowski wanted to be a writer. But for decades his work was rejected\\nby almost every magazine, newspaper, journal, agent, and publisher he\\nsubmitted to. His work was horrible, they said. Crude. Disgusting. Depraved.\\nAnd as the stacks of rejection slips piled up, the weight of his failures pushed\\nhim deep into an alcohol-fueled depression that would follow him for most of\\nhis life.\\nBukowski had a day job as a letter-filer at a post office. He got paid shit\\nmoney and spent most of it on booze. He \\ngambled away the rest at the\\nracetrack. At night, he would drink alone and sometimes hammer out poetry\\non his beat-up old typewriter. Often, he’d wake up on the floor, having\\npassed out the night before.\\nThirty years went by like this, most of it a meaningless blur of alcohol,\\ndrugs, gambling, and prostitutes. Then, when Bukowski was fifty, after a\\nlifetime of failure and self-loathing, an editor at a small independent\\npublishing house took a strange interest in him. The editor couldn’t offer\\nBukowski much money or much promise of sales. But he had a weird\\naffection for the drunk loser, so he decided to take a chance on him. It was\\nthe first real shot Bukowski had ever gotten, and, he realized, probably the\\nonly one he would ever get. Bukowski wrote back to the editor: “I have one\\nof two choices—stay in the post office and go crazy . . . or stay out here and\\nplay at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.”'),\n",

He would go on and\\npublish six novels and hundreds of poems, selling over two million copies of\\nhis books. His popularity defied everyone’s expectations, particularly his\\nown.\\nStories like Bukowski’s are the bread and butter of our cultural narrative.\\nBukowski’s life embodies the American Dream: a man fights for what he\\nwants, never gives up, and eventually achieves his wildest dreams. It’s\\npractically a movie waiting to happen. We all look at stories like Bukowski’s\\nand \\nsay, “See? He never gave up. He never stopped trying. He always\\nbelieved in himself. He persisted against all the odds and made something of\\nhimself!”\\nIt is then strange that on Bukowski’s tombstone, the epitaph reads: “Don’t\\ntry.”\\nSee, despite the book sales and the fame, Bukowski was a loser. He knew\\nit. And his success stemmed not from some determination to be a winner, but\\nfrom the fact that he \\nknew\\n he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote honestly\\nabout it. He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genius in\\nBukowski’s work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing\\nhimself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple\\nability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself—especially the\\nworst parts of himself—and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt.\\nThis is the real story of Bukowski’s success: his comfort with himself as a\\nfailure. Bukowski didn’t give a fuck about success. Even after his fame, he\\nstill showed up to poetry readings hammered and verbally abused people in\\nhis audience. He still exposed himself in public and tried to sleep with every\\nwoman he could find. Fame and success didn’t make him a better person. Nor\\nwas it by becoming a better person that he became famous and successful.\\nSelf-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t\\nnecessarily mean they’re the same thing.\\nOur culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive\\nexpectations: Be happier. Be healthier.

In fact, indifferent people often attempt to be\\nindifferent because in reality they give way too many fucks. They give a fuck\\nabout what everyone thinks of their hair, so they never bother washing or\\ncombing it. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their ideas, so\\nthey hide behind sarcasm and self-righteous snark. They’re afraid to let\\nanyone get close to them, so they imagine themselves as some special, unique\\nsnowflake who has problems that nobody else would ever understand.\\nIndifferent people are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their\\nown choices.

Had I been indifferent, I would have shrugged my\\nshoulders, sipped my mocha, and downloaded another season of \\nThe Wire.\\nSorry, Mom.\\nBut instead, I was indignant. I was pissed off. I said, “No, screw that,\\nMom. We’re going to lawyer the fuck up and go after this asshole. Why?\\nBecause I don’t give a fuck.

The child would never know a moment of suffering—every need,\\nevery desire, would be accounted for at all times.\\nThe king built high walls around the palace that prevented the prince\\nfrom knowing the outside world. He spoiled the child, lavishing him with\\nfood and gifts, surrounding him with servants who catered to his every whim.\\nAnd just as planned, the child grew up ignorant of the routine cruelties of\\nhuman existence.\\nAll of the prince’s childhood went on like this. But despite the endless\\nluxury and opulence, the prince became \\nkind of a pissed-off young man.\\nSoon, every experience felt empty and valueless. The problem was that no\\nmatter what his father gave him, it never seemed enough, never \\nmeant\\nanything.\\nSo late one night, the prince snuck out of the palace to see what was\\nbeyond its walls. He had a servant drive him through the local village, and\\nwhat he saw horrified him.\\nFor the first time in his life, the prince saw human suffering. He saw sick\\npeople, old people, homeless people, people in pain, even people dying.\\nThe prince returned to the palace and found himself in a sort of existential\\ncrisis. Not knowing how to process what he’d seen, he got all emo about\\neverything and complained a lot. And, as is so typical of young men, the\\nprince ended up blaming his father for the very things his father had tried to\\ndo for him.

It is\\nnature’s preferred agent for inspiring change. We have evolved to always live\\nwith a certain degree \\nof dissatisfaction and insecurity, because it’s the mildly\\ndissatisfied and insecure creature that’s going to do the most work to\\ninnovate and survive. We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we\\nhave and satisfied by only what we do not have. This constant dissatisfaction\\nhas kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering. So no—\\nour own pain and misery aren’t a bug of human evolution; they’re a feature.\\nPain, in all of its forms, is our body’s most effective means of spurring\\naction. Take something as simple as stubbing your toe. If you’re like me,\\nwhen you stub your toe you scream enough four-letter words to make Pope\\nFrancis cry. You also probably blame some poor inanimate object for your\\nsuffering. “Stupid table,” you say. Or maybe you even go so far as to\\nquestion your entire interior design philosophy based on your throbbing foot:\\n“What kind of idiot puts a table there anyway? Seriously?”\\nBut I digress. That horrible stubbed-toe-induced pain, the one you and I\\nand the pope hate so much, exists for an important reason. Physical pain is a\\nproduct of our nervous system, a feedback mechanism to give us a sense of\\nour own physical proportions—where we can and cannot move and what we\\ncan and cannot touch. When we exceed those limits, our nervous system duly\\npunishes us to make sure that we pay attention and never do it again.\\nAnd this pain, as much as we hate it, \\nis\\n useful. Pain is what teaches us\\nwhat to pay attention to when we’re young or careless. It helps show us\\nwhat’s good for us versus what’s bad for us. It helps us understand and\\nadhere to our own \\nlimitations. It teaches us to not fuck around near hot stoves\\nor stick metal objects into electrical sockets. Therefore, it’s not always\\nbeneficial to avoid pain and seek pleasure, since pain can, at times, be life-or-\\ndeath important to our well-being.\\nBut pain is not merely physical.

And like our\\nphysical pain, our psychological pain is not necessarily always bad or even\\nundesirable. In some cases, experiencing emotional or psychological pain can\\nbe healthy or necessary.

Others lead\\nto bad problems that are not easily and regularly solved.\\nShitty Values\\nThere are a handful of common values that create really poor problems for\\npeople—problems that can hardly be solved. So let’s go over some of them\\nquickly:\\n1.   \\nPleasure.\\n Pleasure is great, but it’s a horrible value to prioritize your life\\naround. Ask any drug addict how his pursuit of pleasure turned out. Ask\\nan adulterer who shattered her family and lost her children whether\\npleasure ultimately made her happy. Ask a man who almost ate himself to\\ndeath how pleasure helped him solve his problems.\\n               \\nPleasure is a false god.

When people measure themselves not by their\\nbehavior, but by the status symbols they’re able to collect, then not only\\nare they shallow, but they’re probably assholes as well.\\n3.   \\nAlways Being Right.\\nOur brains are inefficient machines. We consistently\\nmake poor assumptions, misjudge probabilities, misremember facts, give\\nin to cognitive biases, and make decisions based on our emotional whims.\\nAs humans, we’re wrong pretty much constantly, so if your metric for life\\nsuccess is to be right—well, you’re going to have a difficult time\\nrationalizing all of the bullshit to yourself.\\nThe fact is, people who base their self-worth on being right about\\neverything prevent themselves from learning from their mistakes. They\\nlack the ability to take on new perspectives and empathize with others.\\nThey close themselves off to new and important information.\\nIt’s far more helpful to assume that you’re ignorant and don’t know a\\nwhole lot. This keeps you unattached to superstitious or poorly informed\\nbeliefs and promotes a constant state of learning and growth.\\n4.   \\nStaying Positive. \\nThen there are those who measure their lives by the\\nability to be positive about, well, pretty much everything. Lost your job?\\nGreat! That’s an opportunity to explore your passions. Husband cheated\\non you with your sister? Well, at least you’re learning what you really\\nmean to the people around you.

To deny that\\nnegativity is to \\nperpetuate\\n problems rather than solve them.\\nThe trick with negative emotions is to 1) express them in a socially\\nacceptable and healthy manner and 2) express them in a way that aligns\\nwith your values.

Don’t\\nblame the messenger. Blame my fist (or your face).\\nWhen we force ourselves to stay positive at all times, we deny the\\nexistence of our life’s problems.

Many described their lives before the war as if they’d been\\ndifferent people then: ungrateful for and unappreciative of their loved ones,\\nlazy and consumed by petty problems, entitled to all they’d been given.

And\\nit’s because of this unique mental ability, Becker says, that we all, at\\nsome point, become aware of the inevitability of our own death. Because\\nwe’re able to conceptualize alternate versions of reality, we are also the\\nonly animal capable of imagining a reality without ourselves in it.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck by Mark Manson', 'page': 133}, page_content='This realization causes what Becker calls “death terror,” a deep\\nexistential anxiety that underlies \\neverything \\nwe think or do.\\n2.   Becker’s second point starts with the premise that we essentially have two\\n“selves.” The first self is the physical self—the one that eats, sleeps,\\nsnores, and poops. The second self is our conceptual self—our identity, or\\nhow we see ourselves.\\nBecker’s argument is this: We are all aware on some \\nlevel that our\\nphysical self will eventually die, that this death is inevitable, and that its\\ninevitability—on some unconscious level—scares the shit out of us.\\nTherefore, in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our\\nphysical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever.\\nThis is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings, on statues,\\non spines of books. It’s why we feel compelled to spend so much time\\ngiving ourselves to others, especially to children, in the hopes that our\\ninfluence—our conceptual self—will last way beyond our physical self.\\nThat we will be remembered and revered and idolized long after our\\nphysical self ceases to exist.\\nBecker called such efforts our “immortality projects,” projects that\\nallow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical\\ndeath. All of human civilization, he says, is basically a result of\\nimmortality projects: the cities and governments and structures and\\nauthorities in place today were all immortality projects of men and\\nwomen who came before us. They are the remnants of conceptual selves\\nthat ceased to die. Names like Jesus, Muhammad, Napoleon, and\\nShakespeare are just as powerful today as when those men lived, if not\\nmore so. And that’s the whole point. Whether it be through mastering an\\nart form, conquering a new land, gaining great riches, or simply having a\\nlarge and loving family that will live on for generations, \\nall the meaning\\nin our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die.\\nReligion, politics, sports, art, and technological innovation are the result\\nof people’s immortality projects. Becker argues that wars and revolutions and\\nmass murder occur when one group of people’s immortality projects rub up\\nagainst another group’s. Centuries of oppression and the bloodshed of\\nmillions have been justified as the defense of one group’s immortality project\\nagainst another’s.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck by Mark Manson', 'page': 134}, page_content='But, when our immortality projects fail, when the meaning is lost, when\\nthe prospect of our conceptual self outliving our physical self no longer\\nseems possible or likely, death terror—that horrible, depressing anxiety—\\ncreeps back into our mind. Trauma can cause this, as can shame and social\\nridicule. As can, as Becker points out, mental illness.\\nIf you haven’t figured it out yet, our immortality projects are our values.\\nThey are the barometers of meaning and worth in our life. And when our\\nvalues fail, so do we, psychologically speaking. What Becker is saying, in\\nessence, is that we’re all driven by fear to give way too many fucks about\\nsomething, because giving a fuck about something is the only thing that\\ndistracts us from the reality and inevitability of our own death. And to truly\\nnot give a single fuck is to achieve a quasi-spiritual state of embracing the\\nimpermanence of one’s own existence. In that state, one is far less likely to\\nget caught up in various forms of entitlement.\\nBecker later came to a startling realization on his deathbed: that people’s\\nimmortality projects were actually the problem, not the solution; that rather\\nthan attempting to implement, often through lethal force, their conceptual self\\nacross the world, people should question their conceptual \\nself and become\\nmore comfortable with the reality of their own death. Becker called this “the\\nbitter antidote,” and struggled with reconciling it himself as he stared down\\nhis own demise. While death is bad, it is inevitable. Therefore, we should not\\navoid this realization, but rather come to terms with it as best we can.\\nBecause once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death—the\\nroot terror, the underlying anxiety motivating all of life’s frivolous ambitions\\n—we can then choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical\\nquest for immortality, and freed from dangerous dogmatic views.\\nThe Sunny Side of Death\\nI step from rock to rock, climbing steadily, leg muscles stretching and aching.\\nIn that trancelike state that comes from slow, repetitive physical exertion, I’m\\nnearing the top.

Becker’s second point starts with the premise that we essentially have two\\n“selves.” The first self is the physical self—the one that eats, sleeps,\\nsnores, and poops. The second self is our conceptual self—our identity, or\\nhow we see ourselves.\\nBecker’s argument is this: We are all aware on some \\nlevel that our\\nphysical self will eventually die, that this death is inevitable, and that its\\ninevitability—on some unconscious level—scares the shit out of us.\\nTherefore, in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our\\nphysical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever.\\nThis is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings, on statues,\\non spines of books.

All of human civilization, he says, is basically a result of\\nimmortality projects: the cities and governments and structures and\\nauthorities in place today were all immortality projects of men and\\nwomen who came before us. They are the remnants of conceptual selves\\nthat ceased to die. Names like Jesus, Muhammad, Napoleon, and\\nShakespeare are just as powerful today as when those men lived, if not\\nmore so.
